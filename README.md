<h1>Full Stack MERN Project | React + Redux, Node, Express, MongoDB | Deploy : https://memory-cards-tanmay.netlify.app/ </h1>
<p>Memory Cards is a Full-Stack MERN web application that can be used to store your memories in form card templates, i.e. a Memory Card would contain the name of the Creator, Title, Message, #tags related to the memory & an image, also one could Like or Delete a card.</p>
<br>
<p>Building this project gave me an overall understanding of frontend-backend communication through API(RESTfull), routing & making various queries & performing all C.U.R.D operations on MongoDB via backend.
</p>
<h5>I focused on making the project scalable by :</h5>
<ul>
<li>maintaining a proper & clean components tree in React.</li>
<li>storing string values in separate constants.js file to avoid typos.</li>
<li>
maintaining a proper backend structure by keeping server, controllers, models & routes logics discrete and distinct.</li>
<li>
maintained a responsive design.</li>
</ul>
